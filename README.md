This is a project created in React JS using TypeScript, Material UI, Redux, JEST, Emotion etc.

It consists of a table that displays different projects with their names, descriptions and users.
You can add a new project to the table, add a new user as well as edit a project if you'd like to.

### How to begin:

1. First, clone the project

2. Run 'yarn' to install the dependencies

3. Run 'yarn start'

4. Check your browser

5. The application will run

I have also uploaded it to Netlify.

### How to run the tests:

It was a challenge since I have never used Redux before, only context API. That made me improve skills.

Hope you like it,
