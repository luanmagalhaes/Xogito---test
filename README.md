This is a project created in React JS using TypeScript, Material UI, Redux, JEST, Emotion etc.

It consists of a table that displays different projects with their names, descriptions and users.
You can add a new project to the table, add a new user as well as edit a project if you'd like to.

I have created a to-do list on Notion so I could organize the process of creating the project:

### How to begin:

1. First, clone the project

2. Run 'yarn' to install the dependencies

3. Run 'yarn start'

4. Check your browser

5. The application will run

I have also uploaded it to Netlify.
You may want to go to https://projects-table-xogito.netlify.app/ to check it online.

### How to run the tests:

1. Open terminal

2. Run 'yarn test'

It was a challenge since I have never used Redux before, only context API. That made me improve skills.

Hope you like it,
